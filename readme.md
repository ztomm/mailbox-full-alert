# Mailbox Full Alert (quota warning)

![Icon](src/icons/icon-256.png)

**Get notified when your mailbox space is almost full.**

Mailbox Full Alert (MFA) is a Thunderbird addon that monitors mailbox usage and warns you when the configured quota is exceeded.

---

Many mail providers, especially free ones, do not make server-side quota information available. Because of this, Thunderbird cannot determine how much space is left on the server. This add-on addresses the issue by letting you manually define a quota per account. It then compares this limit with the actual disk space used by the account locally.

**Note:** This add-on works best with IMAP accounts, where the local mailbox storage usually reflects the actual content on the server.
