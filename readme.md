# Mailbox Full Alert (quota warning)

![Icon](icons/icon-256.png)

**Get notified when your mailbox space is almost full.**

Mailbox Full Alert (MFA) is a Thunderbird addon that monitors mailbox usage and warns you when the configured quota is exceeded.

---

## Motivation

Many providers (for example **Gmail**, **Outlook.com**, and several country-specific providers such as **GMX**) do not report mailbox quota automatically.  
Since Thunderbird cannot fetch quota information from them, the only reliable option is to measure the used space locally.
